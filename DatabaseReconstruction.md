In 0.8.x versions development stuck, because of database lacks fields.
Versions 0.9.x we be able to use feeds tree, feeds filter and individual feeds properties.

This release (version 0.9.0) is aimed to reconstruct the database with small improvement of other parts of application. Please, feel free in your feedback.
